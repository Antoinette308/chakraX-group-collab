# 🌿 ChakraX – Productivity & Wellness Tracker

ChakraX is a fullstack JavaScript web application designed to support personal productivity, wellbeing, and goal setting through:

- ✅ Daily Habit Tracker
- ✍️ Journaling
- 🔋 Energy Management Tool
- 📋 To-Do List
- 🎁 Rewards system


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Chakra UI
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL (via Sequelize)
- **Testing**: Jest


## 👥 Team Collaboration

This project was built collaboratively by a team of six developers over 4 weeks.

### My Contributions:
- 🔐 Built the full **Auth API** using Express, bcrypt, and JWT:
  - Secure user registration and login
  - Token-based password reset with expiry
  - Account update and deletion logic
- 🧪 Configured **Jest** to work with ES6 modules in the backend
- 🧰 Assisted in debugging API integration and testing


## 🚀 Future Plans

The team intends to:
- Split the project into modular frontend/backend repos
- Refactor for scalability and deployment (e.g., Vercel + Render)
- Add localStorage persistence and role-based auth
