## 👥 Team Collaboration

This project was built collaboratively by a team of six developers over 4 weeks.


## 🎯 My Contributions

I contributed primarily to the frontend development as well as the frontend and backend integration with APIs.

### 💻 Frontend Development
- Built the Sign In functionality using React, including reusable components, form state management, and routing to the Sign Up page.
- Developed the ToDo feature UI, using useState and useEffect to render and manage tasks dynamically.
- Styled components with CSS modules, improving layout, spacing, and overall UI consistency.

### 🌐 Backend Integration & API Work
- Integrated frontend components with backend APIs using GET and POST requests to create and retrieve tasks.
- Contributed to backend routing and controller-level debugging.

### 🔄 Collaboration & Workflow
- Collaborated in a team environment using Git and GitHub, working with feature branches and pull requests.
- Iterated on features through testing, debugging, and refinement alongside teammates.


## 🚀 Future Plans

The team intends to:
- Split the project into modular frontend/backend repos
- Refactor for scalability and deployment (e.g., Vercel + Render)
- Add localStorage persistence and role-based auth
